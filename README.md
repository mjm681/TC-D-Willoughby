*Organic Dairy Farm Data Analysis*

This repository involves the data investigation and analysis of data from a small organic dairy farm located in Loughburough. 
Most of the data involves milkings, but some concerns cattle hereditary information. 

This is self-driven project to practice some data analysis with the hope of finding out some interesting, and possibly useful things for the business. 


## Possible Aims: 

* Genetics of the herd
* Number of visits vs stage of lactation vs yield (previous years)
* Number of visits vs bulling
* Yield vs conc and time of year 
* Yield vs conc vs milk price vs profit


## Files contained in this repository:

* **README.md**
  * Classic readme file for this project
* **loading_merlin_data.R**
  * All the column headings for different sheets from the software
* **genetics.R**
  * Investigating the genetics of the cows
